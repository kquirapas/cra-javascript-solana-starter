## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template cra-javascript-solana-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.js`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our hooks to work.

on `src/App.js`, you'll find the `useProgram` hook to show you how to connect and start interacting with your Solana program.
